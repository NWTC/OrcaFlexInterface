OrcaFlex is a commercial software package developed by Orcina for the design and analysis of marine systems. When the OrcaFlexInterface module 
is used in [FAST v8] (https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8 "FAST8"), all hydrodynamic and mooring loads will be computed using OrcaFlex, while the turbine, 
tower, and floating platform structural dynamics; aerodynamics; and control and electrical-drive dynamics will be computed by FAST.

For more information, please refer to documentation on the [OrcaFlex Interface web site](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/OrcaFlexInterface "OrcaFlexInterface").
